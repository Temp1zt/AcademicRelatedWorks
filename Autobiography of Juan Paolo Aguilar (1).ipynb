    "<p style='text-align:left;'>Hello World! I'm <b><i> Juan Paolo Aguilar. </b></i> quickly introduce myself, I'm a Male of legal age who resides around <b> Makati City </b> and whose <b> hobbies </b> are playing games that I find interesting, Watching series that get recommended to me or I'm interested in, and studying. Studying is a hobby that I recently participated in due to my new University being in the Top 4 Universities in the Philippines. I'm the <b> type of person </b> who usually lazes around everywhere and tends to procrastinate things, but with that negative trait about me, I also hold some positives. Despite my procrastination, I am success-driven; I also care for others while balancing taking care of myself. Lastly, I tend to be more of an introvert than an extrovert, but that doesn't mean I don't try to explore out of my comfort zone. I casually strive to improve my physical attributes and overall skills despite considering myself as someone who still has a lot to learn. </i></p> \n",

    "<p><left> During my early childhood, I resided in <i> Tondo, Manila,</i> attending <b> Gen. Maximino Elementary School </b> as a young student. After completing my elementary education, I embarked on a new chapter of my academic journey by enrolling at the <b> University of the East in Manila </b> for my <i> high school years. </i> It was during my second year of high school, specifically in Grade 8, when my family and I relocated to <i> Amaia Skies Avenida. </i> There, I lived alongside my sister and grandmother until the end of my 10th-grade year. Seeking a more spacious living arrangement, we made yet another move to <i> Sampaloc. </i>  Transitioning into my senior high school year, around Grade 11, we embarked on another relocation, this time to a more expansive residence in  <i> San Miguel Village, Makati. </i> Remarkably, we continue to call this place our home to this day, creating enduring memories in this vibrant community. </p>\n",
